# Real Estate Sector Metrics

## Equity REITs

**Representative Companies:** O, AMT, PLD, SPG, EQIX, DLR

| Metric | Description | Good Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **FFO (Funds From Operations)** | Operating cash flow, replaces GAAP net income | Growing trend |
| **AFFO (Adjusted FFO)** | FFO minus maintenance CapEx, true dividend capacity | 80%+ of FFO |
| **P/FFO** | FFO-based P/E ratio | Compare to sector average |
| **Dividend Yield** | Annual dividend / Price | 4-6% typical |
| **Payout Ratio (FFO basis)** | Dividend / FFO | Below 80% safe |
| **Cap Rate** | NOI / Property value | Compare to market rates |
| **Occupancy Rate** | Leased building percentage | 95%+ excellent |
| **WALT** | Weighted average lease term | Longer is more stable |

### GAAP vs Non-GAAP Notes
- GAAP net income includes depreciation (real estate often appreciates, causing distortion)
- **FFO, AFFO** are the standard for REIT valuation
- AFFO is more conservative as it accounts for maintenance needs

### Key Considerations
- Different REIT types have different metrics (data centers vs retail vs industrial)
- Interest rate sensitivity affects valuations
- Cap rate spread vs treasury yields indicates relative value
