# Healthcare Sector Metrics

## Biotech

**Representative Companies:** AMGN, GILD, BIIB, VRTX, REGN

| Metric | Description | Good Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Pipeline Stage** | Phase 1/2/3, approval probability | Phase 3+ promising |
| **Burn Rate** | Monthly cash consumption | 2+ year runway |
| **Runway** | Cash / Monthly burn, survival period | 24+ months safe |
| **Success Probability** | Stage-specific approval odds | Phase 3: ~60% |
| **Peak Sales Estimate** | Maximum annual revenue if approved | Compare to market cap |
| **Patent Expiry** | Key drug patent expiration | 5+ years safe |

### Key Notes
- Most are loss-making, so GAAP financials matter less than **pipeline value**
- Cash position and runway determine survival
- Binary events (clinical trial results) drive major price moves

### Valuation Approach
- Sum-of-parts based on pipeline risk-adjusted NPV
- Compare peak sales potential to current market cap
- Cash value as floor valuation

## Pharma / Medical Devices

**Representative Companies:** JNJ, PFE, MRK, ABBV, MDT, ABT

| Metric | Description | Good Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Revenue Growth** | Existing + new products | 5%+ stable |
| **R&D Ratio** | Pipeline investment | 15-20% appropriate |
| **Patent Cliff** | Major drug patent expiration timing | 5+ years safe |
| **Pipeline Value** | Value of drugs in development | Compare to market cap |
| **Pricing Power** | Ability to raise drug prices | Depends on regulation |

### Key Considerations
- Patent cliffs can significantly impact revenue
- M&A often used to replenish pipeline
- Regulatory and pricing pressure are ongoing risks
- Diversification across therapeutic areas provides stability
